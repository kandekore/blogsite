A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

- The Motivation for building this application was to give a place for developers to share information and discuss topics
- The application was built to demonstrate my ubderstanding of MVC
